Without the presence of an enormous amount of data, the self-regulating systems cannot be created. So, Data Science in 2020 would be all about crunching huge amounts of data for Business Analytics.In simple words, Data Science is a comprehensive study of data collected by various organizations for their business purposes. It involves the analysis of the gliding data over the Internet through various data analysis tools']],

    [r'.*\bEmbedded system\b.*',['An embedded system is a dedicated computer system designed for one or two specific functions. This system is embedded as a part of a complete device system that includes hardware, such as electrical and mechanical components.In a simple words as its name suggests, Embedded means something that is attached to another thing. An embedded system can be thought of as a computer hardware system having software embedded in it. An embedded system can be an independent system or it can be a part of a large system. An embedded system is a microcontroller or microprocessor based system which is designed to perform a specific task.Embedded systems are more than a part of human life. For example, no one can imagine life without a mobile phone for personal interaction. Its presence is practically indispensable in almost all aspects of human endeavour. Almost every electronic product designed today includes at least one microcontroller or other embedded processor.The course provides in-depth understanding of architecture, pin detail and microcomputer controller interfaces with various input and output peripherals. The course includes study of lower end, middle range and high end microcontroller’s .It also provides an understanding of serial communication protocols.']],
